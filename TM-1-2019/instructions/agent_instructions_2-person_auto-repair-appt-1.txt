Agent instructions - Auto-repair-appt-1


In these conversations, users will call their assistant to set up an auto repair appointment with a repair shop called “Intelligent Auto Imports”.


Your job as the Assistant is to set up the appointment on their behalf. By the end of the conversation, you’ll need to gather the following information. Do not feel compelled to do things in this exact order though. AND of course you’ll need to take several turns to gather these bits.


* name.customer
   * “Gina Jones”  (not their real name)


* phone.customer
   * 10-digit telephone number (not their real number)


CONFIRM the name and phone number HERE---do not wait until the end of the call


* reason.appt
   * Users will describe their problem, e.g. “tune up”, “there’s a funny noise when I turn”, “It keeps stalling”, “pulls to the left”, “leaking oil”, etc.


* Date.appt
   * You should start by asking them which day/date they need the appointment for.
   * Can be actual dates like “April 29th” as well as days of the week “this Friday”, etc.


* time.appt
   * You should let them know that the usual procedure is for them to drop off their car before 8:30am on the day of the appointment.
   * However, some users will give you a particular preference like: “I’d like someone to take a look this afternoon”, “at 2pm”, “ASAP”, etc. IMPORTANT: If they do ask for a non-standard time such as that described above, tell EVERY OTHER customer of this type that right now the shop only has availability tomorrow and that they should drop their car off before 8:30. (For the other half you can accommodate their more immediate time request.)


* name.vehicle
   * Includes make e.g. “Toyota”, model e.g. “Camry” and any additional description, e.g. “vintage”, “modified”, “convertible”, etc.


* Year.vehicle


OPTIONAL - They may mention the store’s location themselves.
* location.store
   * any location info, city, street address, neighborhood that the user may mention.
To finish the call:
* FIRST: confirm make, model and year, reason, date  & time.
* SECOND: Let them know there is a $89 fee for the inspection but that it will go towards the actual fees to fix the car if they choose to go ahead
* Once they agree, confirm all is set and say your goodbyes.
