Agent Instructions - Pizza Ordering 1


1. Users will base this task on their own pizza preferences like ideal toppings, sizes, specials, etc.


2. MAIN TASK: With these ideas in mind, users will pretend to use their voice-powered, personal digital assistant to make a pizza order from a new pizzeria called "Bella Luna".


3. You will need to get answers for the following:
* Number of pizzas
* Size (all pizzas will be the same size)
* Toppings or pizza type: (e.g. names like "chicken bbq" or "veggie lovers", "meat lovers" -- use your imagination and experience.)
* Special instructions: They will have crust preferences or extra cheese, etc.


4. As the assistant, please CONFIRM all relevant details from (3) above before moving ahead.


5. You can assume users already have an account with Bella Luna Pizzeria online which the assistant knows, so no credit card information is necessary.


6. The assistant should end the conversation by confirming the total price charged to the user’s account:
* assume pizzas are small =  12.99, Med =  18.99, large = 23.99
* you can make up a rough total number for the final price that includes “tax and ordering fee” if they ask.


7. To end the call, tell the users that the pizza(s) are on order at the local Bella Luna pizzeria and will be ready for pickup shortly.
