Agent instructions - movie-tickets-2


*MAIN TASK: Users will pretend they’re using a voice-powered personal digital assistant to book movie tickets for a film they ALREADY have in mind. (Google the movie name and theater based on the location to find available showtimes and other details.)


1. In several turns (not just one!), cover the following:
* Theater
* City
* Film name


2. In the next few turns, get this information:
* Number of tickets need
* Time of day (it will be today)
* If applicable: 3D vs. IMAX vs. standard.


3. They may also want to know things like:
* Run time (how long the movie is)
* Director
* Actors (give them the main two)


4. Make sure to CONFIRM all the relevant ticket details before the end of the dialogue INCLUDING:
* Total cost for the ticket(s)
* Note: You can assume you have the user’s account info with the ticket service--so no credit card information is necessary.


5. HERE’s THE NEW and IMPORTANT PART:
* After confirming the details, tell the user you’re sorry but the movie time they want is SOLD OUT.
* After that, ask them to choose another time or they can cancel their order. (Their choice.)


6. End the conversation by confirming either:
(a) that the tickets are being sent to the user’s mobile device as a text message. 
Or
(b) (if they cancel) that no were charges made to their account.
