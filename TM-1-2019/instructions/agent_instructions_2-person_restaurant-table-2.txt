Agent instructions - restaurant-table-2


(This task is similar to the recent "restaurant-table-1" but there is MORE searching and NO table booking.)


1. THE SCENARIO: Users will pretend they are searching for a place to eat LUNCH in SACRAMENTO.


2. The user will say they are at one of these two specific locations:
* The Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento, CA 
   * (this can include the Elephant Bar and Olive Garden which are across the street)
* Midtown near L St. & 19th St. in Sacramento, CA
   * (everything within 5-10 blocks should be fair game)


3. When you get into the actual dialogue, the users will be searching for a restaurant based on their actual preferences.
* Use GOOGLE for all your searches and details. (not yelp or other external sites)
* TYPES OF FOOD they like
* THREE additional restaurant characteristics (these should be genuine and specific to what the user likes)


4. When they’ve given you all this information...
* First offer them 2-3 restaurants to choose from.
   * For each one paste part of the blurb found in the Google results (not the whole thing if it’s too long. Maybe just the first sentence....use your judgment).
* Second, have them ask 2-3 questions about each one. (They are told to do this in their instructions.)


5. AFTER all of (3-4), they will need to choose one AND get the restaurant’s phone number.


6. No table reservations in this activity.


 REMEMBER: Use GOOGLE for all your searches and details. (not yelp or other external sites)


7. You can end the dialogue once they have confirmed they have got the phone number.
