Agent instructions - movie-tickets-1


*MAIN TASK: Users will pretend they’re using a voice-powered personal digital assistant to book movie tickets for a film they ALREADY have in mind.


1. In several turns (not just one!), cover the following:
* Film name
* Number of people
* City
* Theater
* Time
* If applicable: 3D vs. IMAX vs. standard.


2. They may also want to know things like:
* Run time
* End time
* Director, actors, etc.


3. Make sure to CONFIRM all the relevant ticket details before the end of the dialogue INCLUDING:
* Total cost for two tickets
* Time, location, theater


4. You can assume you have the user’s account info with the ticket service--so no credit card information is necessary.


6. After confirming the details, end the conversation by confirming that the tickets are being sent to the user’s mobile device as a text message.
