<U>Yes, that was a great movie. It had suspense, action and comedy. Great acting talent as well. That makes me excited for Terminator Dark Fate as well. Are any of the original cast back?<C><U>I really enjoy a movie full of suspense and good character development. I have heard mixed reviews of the Joker, Gemini Man and Countdown. These seem to me to be promising. Please check the reviews in the NYT and Chicago Sun?<A>I’ll get right on that. I have seen that mental health is a big focus in Joker.<U>I like to feel like I’m a part of the movie and get to see inside the minds of the characters. That is one reason I want to see Joker.

I will look into Terminator as well.<U>I really don’t enjoy the typical comic book based movie so I’m glad to hear cinematography is good in Joker.<A>Gemini man has an interesting duality question at its core.
